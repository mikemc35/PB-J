This is a test of *how* you might go ahead and write some markdown.

This is a ~~strikethrough~~ just in case you coudn't figure **that** out.

If you wanted to start a numbered list, then you do this:

1. Test the thingee.
  * And here's a second-level first step thing.
2. Start the other thing.
3. Run for congress.
4. Success.

Here's an in-text link to http://www.google.com

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)



[Here's another example of an inline link](http://hello.com)


And here's some inline code text:

```c++
include iostream.h;

  int main() {
    cout<<"This prints something."\n;
  return 0;
  }
```


I'm gonna make the following table now:

| Command | Description | Yes or No? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| sparky | This command sparks up something | Nah |
| trashed | This command trashes something. Cool. | Sure |
